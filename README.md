# Universal Viewer Main Website

## Current State

The site has been rebuilt using Astro, however all frontend assets remain the same, meaning that the website is visually and functionally the same despite the underlying systems having changed.

## Making Changes

Edit `/src/pages/index.astro` as if it were `index.html`

## Publishing Changes

Changes are built and deployed automatically when updates are made to the `main` branch via a GitHub Pages workflow.

In the Environment settings of the repo there is a list of branches from which deployments are allowed. This currently only contains the `main` branch to prevent any other branches being a source of deployment.

# Astro Starter Kit: Basics

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```
